Lesson 3 - Github

Creating remote and sync

1. Github: Create repository with or without readme (as we already have commits)
2. Git remote
	a. Git remote no arguments - see all current remotes
	b. Git remote add +name (usually origin) +url
	c. verify: git remote -v (shows more information)
3. In order to send to remote Git push
	a. Git push +remote +branch we want to push

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
